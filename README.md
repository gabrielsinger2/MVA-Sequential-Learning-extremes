We put into practice the theoretical concepts seen in the article studied for this project (see final report). In particular, we start by coding an extreme version of the PCA with meteorological data, then we illustrate the notion of regular variation for  $ùêø2[0,1]$  valued stochastic processes.

You'll also find the results of the practical work associated with this first-semester MVA course at ENS.
