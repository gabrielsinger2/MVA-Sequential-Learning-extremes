We put into practice the theoretical concepts seen in the article (https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01023) studied for this project (see final report). In particular, we start by coding an extreme version of the PCA with meteorological data, then we illustrate the notion of regular variation for  $ùêø^{2}([0,1], dx)$  valued stochastic processes.

You'll also find the results of the practical work associated with this first-semester MVA course at ENS. 
Homework is either theoretical or practical. Here you'll find two theoretical homework assignments. The first shows that a result of uniform convergence of a sequence of functions is useful in the context of extreme value theory. The second explores theoretical aspects closely or distantly related to extreme value theory.
